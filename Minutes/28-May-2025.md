## ⚠️ Participation Barriers – Identified Problem:

A significant barrier observed:
> “Why should I participate if the same people always win?”  
> Many self-exclude due to fear of competition, lack of confidence, or the belief that the event isn’t meant for them.

### ✅ Proposed Solution:
To **broaden inclusivity** and **encourage participation**, the hackathon will include **diverse award categories**, such as:
- **Best Idea**
- **Most Creative Solution**
- **Impactful Story/Prototype**
- And other non-technical recognitions

This approach is intended to **inspire more participants**, especially those outside the typical competition loop, and to emphasize learning, creativity, and community involvement over just winning.
